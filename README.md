# Levy-Flight-Universality-Class
Here you can find the basic code that we used to generate the data for the paper ["Aftermath epidemics: Percolation on the sites visited by generalized random walks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06117)

In this work, we explore the clustering of an infection on a 2D and 3D array. We have two generalized movements: one would be a Levy-Flight, and the other would be the combination of a Levy-Flight with a knight movement on a chess board(in 2D). We explained the numerical results using two methods: one using the standard percolation observables and the other scaling the biggest gap between two giant clusters.
We use the Newmann-ziff algorithm for the simulations.
We see that the 3D knight move belongs to the Pacman percolation class. In the 2D examination, the universality class is not exact because of the new length scales in the system.
